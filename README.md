## Introduction

JavaScript is a versatile language, widely used for both client-side and server-side development. Understanding and applying design patterns can greatly improve the quality of your code. This repository explores various design patterns in JavaScript, providing examples and explanations for each pattern.

## Types of Design Patterns

1. **Creational Patterns:** Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.
2. **Structural Patterns:** Concerned with object composition, ensuring that objects are structured in an efficient and flexible way.
3. **Behavioral Patterns:** Focus on communication between objects, defining how they interact and share responsibilities.

## Patterns Covered

### Creational Patterns:
- Singleton
- Factory
- Prototype
- Builder

### Structural Patterns:
- Module
- Decorator
- Adapter
- Facade

### Behavioral Patterns:
- Observer
- Command
- Strategy
- Chain of Responsibility

Each pattern is explained with code examples and practical use cases.
